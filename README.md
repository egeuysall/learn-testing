# Learn Testing Journey

This repository is my personal playground for learning software testing in multiple languages and frameworks.  
I explore testing concepts, write experiments, and improve code quality through hands-on practice.

## Goals
- Learn unit, integration, and end-to-end testing.
- Experiment with Go tests (`testing` package) and JavaScript/TypeScript tests with Vitest.
- Write clean, maintainable, and reliable tests.

## Tools & Frameworks
- Go: `testing` package
- JavaScript/TypeScript: Vitest
- Additional libraries as needed for experiments
